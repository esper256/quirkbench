# Testing and agent quota

Agent tokens per useful finding are the primary optimization. Routine development
uses focused software regressions. Expensive end-to-end qualification runs only
for an explicitly requested final release of a major version, against a stable
candidate. Milestone acceptance descriptions specify the eventual evidence needed;
they do not instruct agents to rebuild and qualify after each implementation task.

| Work | Validation |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation or policy | Inspect links, consistency and `git diff --check` |
| Local implementation change | Relevant pytest files or test cases |
| Broad software integration | `make test` when justified; push/PR CI runs the software suite |
| Final major-version candidate | Explicit release qualification, with recorded inputs and retained results |

For example, `make test TESTS=tests/test_monitor.py` runs one software suite.
`make test`, `make acceptance-m1` and ordinary CI never invoke real image, VM,
composition or hardware campaigns. Keep expensive fixtures outside pytest's normal
`tests/` collection and out of push/PR CI.

Release targets (`acceptance-m2`, `acceptance-v1-image`, `acceptance-qemu`,
`acceptance-standard-image` and `acceptance-ostree-*`) require
`RELEASE_QUALIFICATION=1`, in addition to their documented inputs. For example:

```sh
make acceptance-v1-image RELEASE_QUALIFICATION=1 IMAGE=... OVMF_CODE=... OVMF_VARS=... WORK_DIR=...
```

The opt-in is a safeguard, not permission to run these automatically. Direct
composition/image commands and qualification scripts follow the same release-only
policy. Hardware endurance is also release-only; the inexpensive commands that
validate an existing hardware or patch report do not themselves run a campaign.

## Long-running work

When an authorized long run is needed, capture its exact command, source/artifact
identities, process or container identity, log location and eventual exit status
in a durable run directory. Use an execution mechanism that survives the agent
turn if the run will continue after returning control. Do not leave a process
attached to a tool session that will terminate it when the turn ends.

If the result does not block development, continue independent work or finish the
turn with a concise pending-status handoff. Do not create a polling automation or
delegate a monitoring agent merely to keep waiting. Do not promise a notification
without an actual completion mechanism. A later status request should read the
saved result, not rerun the test.

Wait only when the result determines the next necessary development step and
there is no independent useful work. Prefer completion notifications over polling;
read compact status or failure excerpts, not repeated full logs. Continuous
progress remains available to humans through existing logs and monitoring without
requiring agent commentary to relay every phase.

At release time, freeze implementation inputs before launching the expensive
gates. Preserve successful evidence and failed-run diagnostics. Diagnose with
focused checks, then repeat only invalidated gates on a stable candidate. Clearly
distinguish historical qualification, current software tests and pending release
qualification. Quota savings never justify silently reusing mismatched evidence.
